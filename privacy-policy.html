    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how the YT Digest extension handles your
      information.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Collection and Usage</h2>
    <p>
      YT Digest extension processes certain user data to provide its core
      functionality. This data is handled as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>User Preferences:</strong> Your preferred default tab (e.g.,
        "transcript", "summary") and your preferred language for summaries are
        stored locally on your device. This data is used solely to personalize
        your experience within the Extension and is not transmitted to any
        external servers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Google Gemini API Key:</strong> If you choose to use the summary
        feature, your Google Gemini API key is stored locally on your device.
        This key is used to authenticate requests made directly from your
        browser to the Google Gemini API for generating video summaries. This
        key is transmitted to Google's servers for the purpose of providing the
        summary service.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>YouTube Video Data:</strong> The Extension fetches YouTube video
        data (such as transcript text, available transcript languages) directly
        from YouTube's servers. This data is processed in real-time within your
        browser to provide the Extension's functionality (displaying transcripts
        and generating summaries) and is not stored persistently by the
        Extension or transmitted to any other third parties.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The Extension does not collect or transmit any personal or sensitive user
      data to the Extension developer's servers.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>
      All data stored by the Extension, including user preferences and your
      Google Gemini API key, resides exclusively on your local device within
      your browser's storage. This data is not accessible by the Extension
      developer or any third parties, except for the transmission of the Google
      Gemini API key to Google's servers as described above.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      YT Digest extension shares your Google Gemini API key with Google's
      servers for the sole purpose of authenticating requests to generate video
      summaries, as initiated by you. No other user data, personal or sensitive,
      is shared with any other third parties for advertising, tracking, or any
      other purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of
      any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are
      advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>
